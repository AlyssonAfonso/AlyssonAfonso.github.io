    Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
    I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
    Face in the mirror is all I need (ooh)
    Wait until the reaper takes my life
    Never gonna get me out alive
    I will live a thousand million lives (ooh)

    

    My patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?
    Our patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?

    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
    Where I'm losing all control
    'Cause there's magic in my bones
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
    Go ahead and throw your stones
    'Cause there's magic in my bones

    Playing with a stick of dynamite
    There was never gray in black and white
    There was never wrong 'til there was right (ooh, oh)
    Feeling like a boulder hurtling
    Seeing all the vultures circling
    Burning in the flames I'm working in
    Turning in a bed that's darkening

    My patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?
    Our patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?
    
    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
    Where I'm losing all control
    'Cause there's magic in my bones (in my bones)
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
    Go ahead and throw your stones
    'Cause there's magic in my bones
    
    'Cause there's magic in my bones

    Look in the mirror of my mind
    Turning the pages of my life
    Walking the path so many paced a million times
    Drown out the voices in the air
    Leaving the ones that never cared
    Picking the pieces up and building to the sky

    My patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?
    My patience is waning
    Is this entertaining?

    I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
    Where I'm losing all control
    'Cause there's magic in my bones (magic in my bones)
    I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (soul)
    Go ahead and throw your stones
    'Cause there's magic in

    There goes my mind (I-I-I)
    Don't mind
    There goes my mind (there it goes, there it goes)
    There goes my mind (I-I-I)
    Don't mind (there it goes)
    There goes my mind
    'Cause there's magic in my bones
